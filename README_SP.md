## What I have learned about GitHub
**Git hub is a place** *where we can keep different* versions of our code, where we can share our code,
and where we can collaborate with other programmers.
Some terms that we will need to become familiar with as we use GitHub are some such as repositories,
cloning, committing, branches, forks, and etc.

I am concerned about if I understood this assignment and I hope that I did it right lol. :rofl:
